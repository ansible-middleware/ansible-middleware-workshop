# 1 - Prerequisites

You will need an Red Hat network account to be able to download the JBoss EAP installation zip files.  The account you use must not be managed by SSO in order for the Ansible scripts to be able to authenticate.  You can create a new account by following the instructions in the [Red Hat Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com/?intcmp=701f20000012k6EAAQ).  You will need to use these credentials when you run the ansible playbooks later in the workshop.

## Set up the environment

This workshop requires the provisioning of the following RHPDS environment.  

Management Automation Workshops Demos -> Ansible Automation Workshop

Once this environment is provisioned your will have the following:

* A bastion node, serving a VS Code Server IDE, which can be used to run the workshop
* 2 x App Servers, which will host JBoss EAP
* 1 x db server, which will host Postgresql
* 1 x frontend server, which will host the load balancer

You will receive an email containing the following information:

```
To access frontend via browser:
https://frontend1.xxxxx.sandbox894.opentlc.com
To access vs code server via browser:
https://bastion.xxxxxx.sandbox894.opentlc.com
Enter default password changme

To access bastion via SSH:
ssh devops@bastion.xxxxxx.sandbox894.opentlc.com
Enter ssh password when prompted: xxxxxxxx


```

To start the workshop, open the url of your bastion server in a browser. You will be prompted to login.  The default password is "changme".  Once you login to the IDE you will be able to start the workshop.


## Check ansible hosts

From the VS Code IDE, open a new terminal by clicking on the "Terminal" menu and selecting "New Terminal".

From the terminal enter the follwing command to copy over the pre-prepared ansible hosts file:

``` cp /etc/ansible/hosts ./inventory ```


Open the file `inventory/hosts`, you should see the hostnames of your nodes similar to those shown below.

```
# Placeholder Group
[demo]

# jboss Group
[jboss]
app1.guid.internal 
app2.guid.internal 

# postgres database Group
[pgsql]
appdb1.guid.internal

# jcbs Group
[jbcs]
frontend1.guid.internal

[demo:children]
jboss
pgsql
jbcs

```

## Test ansible hosts
Once we have checked the hosts file we can test the ansible hosts file by running the following command.

```ansible -i inventory/hosts demo -m ping```

You should see the following output:

```
192.168.122.64 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/libexec/platform-python"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
192.168.122.224 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/libexec/platform-python"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
192.168.122.247 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/libexec/platform-python"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
192.168.122.20 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/libexec/platform-python"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
```

We've checked our environment, now we can continue with the workshop and add the required ansible collections.
