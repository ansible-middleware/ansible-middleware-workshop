# 11 - Conclusion

You can download the completed workshop from here:  https://github.com/deewhyweb/wildfly-cluster-demo/tree/postgresql

The workshop is now complete, we've demonstrated the use of the ansible-middleware collection to deploy JBoss EAP, a J2EE application, and JBoss Core Services as a load balancer.  Persistence is provided by a postresql database.

Once this installation was complete we used the ansible-middleware collection to download and install a JBoss EAP patch to our running instances of JBoss EAP.
